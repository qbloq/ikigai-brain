description: Regenerate a team meeting's structured report (the canonical Spanish jsonb) from its raw transcript, with a powerful evidence-grounded task-discovery pass, then REPLACE it in the DB. Use when the user wants to (re)generate a meeting report, rebuild a report from the transcript, or refresh/overwrite a meeting's report.

# Transcript → Report (Stage 1)

Turn a team meeting's **raw transcript** into the **canonical structured report**
(jsonb, Spanish) and **upsert it into the DB, replacing any existing report
without looking back**.

This is **Stage 1** of the pipeline. It is the upstream sibling of
[meeting-to-tasks](../meeting-to-tasks/SKILL.md) (Stages 2–3): the quality of the
`actionItems` produced here is the seam that feeds task creation, so discovery is
done with care (see §3).

Background (read if unsure): [tasks-system.md](../../../docs/tasks-system.md),
[role-sops-discovery.md](../../../docs/role-sops-discovery.md) (the S1–S10
macro-process spine), [activity-archetypes.md](../../../docs/activity-archetypes.md)
(the A_.__ atomic activities).

## Input
A meeting id or prefix (e.g. `32a519c9`). Find it loosely with
`bash/meetings/meetings.sh --has-transcript`. The meeting MUST be a **team**
meeting with a transcript.

## Workflow

### 1. Fetch transcript + context
```
bash/meetings/meeting_show.sh <id>          # project, scheduled date, status, participants
bash/meetings/meeting_transcript.sh <id>    # the raw diarized text (Speaker A/B/…)
```
Note the **project** and the **meeting date** — both anchor the report
(`meetingContext.date`) and the due-date estimation downstream.

> **Per-task project routing (important).** The meeting's `project` is NOT the
> project of every task. Most team meetings are tagged with the org own project — the agency —
> and coordinate work across clients. Treat that project as the **internal/agency
> bucket only** (S11, team & role ops, own-brand marketing).
> Route each task to its **real project inferred from content** — <proyecto> /
> el proyecto del cliente cuando se nombra una marca/oferta; el proyecto interno solo when
> the work is genuinely internal; **flag** when undecidable (never assume). A
> single meeting can yield tasks for several projects. This lives as a `project`
> column per item in the sidecar (§4).

If there is no transcript, stop and tell the user — there is nothing to generate from.

### 2. Generate the report — canonical schema (be faithful)
Produce ONE jsonb object in Spanish with **exactly these 14 keys** (the whole
corpus uses this shape; `upsert_report.sh` rejects a report missing any of them):

| key | shape |
|---|---|
| `reportTitle` | string |
| `reportSubtitle` | string |
| `executiveSummary` | string |
| `meetingContext` | `{date, duration, meetingType, participants[]}` |
| `meetingObjectives` | `{stated, achieved, unresolved}` |
| `keySubjectAreas` | `[{topic, description}]` |
| `discussionPointsAndDecisions` | `[{topic, summary, decision, rationale}]` |
| `actionItems` | `[{task, dueDate, priority, assignedTo[], dependencies}]` |
| `criticalIssuesAndBlockers` | `[{issue, status, nextSteps}]` |
| `risksAndConcerns` | `[{risk, mitigation}]` |
| `resourceRequirements` | `{budget, personnel, toolsAndEquipment}` |
| `nextStepsAndFollowUp` | `{nextMeeting, reviewPoints, keyMilestones[]}` |
| `futureConsiderations` | `[string]` (or a string — match what the content needs) |
| `additionalNotes` | `[string]` |

Rules:
- **Spanish**, business-analyst register, same voice as the existing corpus.
- Ground everything in the transcript — never invent decisions, numbers, or names.
- `meetingContext.date` = the meeting date (YYYY-MM-DD). List participants as
  spoken (`"Mari (Speaker A)"`, `"Cristian (mencionado)"`).
- `actionItems[].assignedTo` stays as the **names/nicknames spoken in the room**
  (fidelity to the corpus — do NOT canonicalize here; resolution lives in §3).
- `actionItems[].dueDate` / `dependencies` stay as free-text (as discussed).
- Leave `report_es` alone — the script never touches it (corpus keeps it null).

### 3. Powerful task discovery (two passes, evidence-grounded)
The default LLM summary under-discovers: it merges compound commitments, drops
ones only said in passing, and loses owners. Do better:

1. **Narrative pass** → the 12 descriptive keys above.
2. **Commitment-mining pass over the RAW transcript** → scan the whole text for
   every commitment, not just what made the summary: phrases like *"yo hago / me
   encargo / quedamos en / hay que / toca / para el (fecha) / antes de…"*, plus
   implicit owners. Each becomes a **candidate action item**, **atomic** (one
   deliverable each — split compound ones; e.g. "subir presupuesto" and "llegar a
   la meta $2,000" are two items).
3. **Reconcile** the two passes: union, de-duplicate, drop pure restatements.
   Each surviving item must have a transcript **evidence anchor** (a short
   verbatim quote). If you can't anchor it, it isn't an action item.

The reconciled set is what goes into `actionItems` (canonical free-text form) AND
into the sidecar (resolved form, §4).

### 4. Write the discovery sidecar (the seam to Stage 2–3)
Keep the DB report canonical/clean; emit the resolution metadata to a sidecar at
`backups/meeting-reports/<meeting-id>.discovery.md`, one row per action item
(aligned by index to `actionItems`):

| # | task | **project** | assignedTo (spoken) | **owner (canonical)** | **dueDateISO** | priority | **SOP/archetype** | **evidence** |

- **project** ← the real project inferred from the task content (<proyecto> /
  proyecto-cliente / proyecto-interno), NOT inherited from the meeting. Flag
  `⚠️ undecided` when the client can't be determined. See the routing rule in §1.

- **owner (canonical)** ← resolve each `assignedTo` against the live roster
  (`bash/tasks/team.sh`) + the nickname map below. Mark unknowns as
  `⚠️ UNRESOLVED` — **never silently drop**.
- **dueDateISO** ← apply the due-date estimation policy below (always a date).
- **SOP/archetype** ← classify the item against the canonical catalog
  `catalog/sop-archetypes.json` (the source of truth — S1–S12 + the 55 `A_.__`
  archetypes). Put the **archetype id** (e.g. `A2.4`) and its SOP. If nothing
  fits, mark it `gap → S11/S12 candidate` (never force a bad match — the tail
  grows the catalog). This gives Stage 2–3 a strong prior and is persisted on the
  task (`tasks.archetype_id`).
- **evidence** ← the verbatim quote anchoring the item.

`meeting-to-tasks` consumes this sidecar (preferring it over the raw report
actionItems) so it never has to re-guess owners or dates.

### 5. Upsert into the DB (replace without looking back)
Always **dry-run first**, then commit:
```
bash/meetings/upsert_report.sh <id> <report.json> --dry-run   # shows BEFORE/AFTER, rolls back
bash/meetings/upsert_report.sh <id> <report.json>             # INSERT … ON CONFLICT(meeting_id) DO UPDATE
```
The script pre-validates the meeting (exactly one team meeting) and that all 14
canonical keys are present, then upserts in one transaction. An existing report
is overwritten; `updated_at` is refreshed.

## Reference

### due_date estimation (for the sidecar dueDateISO — never null)
Anchor on the **meeting date**, resolve the `dueDate` text:

| `dueDate` says | Resolve to |
|---|---|
| "Hoy" / "Inmediato" / "Ya" | meeting date |
| "Mañana" | meeting date + 1 |
| "Esta semana" | Friday of the meeting's week |
| "Próxima semana" | Monday of next week |
| "Fin de mes" | last day of the meeting's month |
| "Siguiente mes" / "Próximo mes" | last day of next month |
| a concrete date | that date |
| **vague** ("Lo antes posible", "En curso", "Continuo", missing) | **meeting date + priority offset**: High +3 · Medium +7 · Low +14 |

Estimate must be **on or after** the meeting date. Flag estimates as `(est.)`.

### SOP / archetype ontology (for mapping)
**Authoritative catalog: `catalog/sop-archetypes.json`** (also live in the DB:
`sops` + `activity_archetypes`). Use its exact codes/ids — do
not re-derive from prose. The spine: **S1** Narrativa & Oferta · **S2** Creativos ·
**S3** Pauta · **S4** Orgánico · **S5** Testimonios · **S6** Leads/Setter · **S7**
Funnel · **S8** Métricas · **S9** Lanzamiento · **S10** Gobernanza · **S11**
Producto *(gap)* · **S12** Cierre/Retención *(gap)*. Background prose:
role-sops-discovery.md, activity-archetypes.md.

### Nickname → canonical team member  (memory `nickname-to-team-member-map`)
Bala→David Castaño · Jota/Jona→Jhonatan Rengifo · Franco→Francisco Otalvaro ·
Sophie→Sofia · Santi→Santiago Ruiz · Juanca→Juan Camilo Correa · Mari→Marisol
Ochoa · Andrés→Andrés Alzate · Mateo→Mateo Restrepo · Pablo→Pablo Gaviria ·
Toño/Tony→Tony Vidal · Lucho→Luis David Flórez · Loro/Lorenzo→Lorenzo Cadavid
(Ejecutivo, escribe VSLs) · Cisco→Francisco Otalvaro · Robert/Roberto→Roberto
Maestre (Operaciones). The client "David" who records
content = el proyecto del cliente. If a nickname is unknown, mark it
`⚠️ UNRESOLVED` and ask the user — don't guess.

## Principles
- **Faithful schema.** Exactly the 14 canonical keys; Spanish; corpus voice.
  `upsert_report.sh` enforces presence.
- **Replace without looking back**, but **dry-run first** every time.
- **Evidence or it isn't an action item.** Every action item is anchored to a
  transcript quote.
- **Resolve in the sidecar, not the DB report.** The DB report stays canonical
  (spoken names); the sidecar carries the resolved owners / ISO dates / SOP refs.
- **Never silently drop** an owner or a commitment — flag unknowns.
